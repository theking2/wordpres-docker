# WordPress with xdebug enabled

## Contents

This will create a container stack by the same name as the folder it sits in. Change project name in `.env`

```env
project=kundenname
```

at the top and change "kundenname" to something descriptive.

### Dockerfile

Dockerfile that pulls wordpress-apache and sets a couple of neccesary PHP ini-files and enables xdebug.

### compose.yaml

creates two containers `wp` (with the Dockerfile) and `db` for a standard MariaDB in a stack named earlier. The root of the WordPress content folder  `html/wp'content` and the database data are bound to subfolders `app`  to `db` respectively. The website can be accessed by

* localhost:8080/ â†’ `./app` as `wp-content` folder
* The rest of WordPress is irrelevant

If the complete WordPress installation should be availebl in the `app` folder adjust the `compose.yaml` file accordingly. Remember to also adjust the `pathMappings` in the `launch.json` file accordingly.  

## Setup docker containers

First start Docker Desktop. When you're ready, start your application by running:

`docker compose up --build`.

in a terminal. If you have the Docker VSCode Extention installed it is even simpler. Open the `compose.yaml` and  click

After this check the running state of the container in Docker Desktop.

If Docker Desktop or the docker daemon is __not__ running you will see a confusing message:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/22db1c2d-e93e-4eb7-bcf4-92cc40c3bf93)

If that happens start Docker Desktop and try again.

Setting up the database might take some time on slower hardware. Make sure that activity in the docker has died down.

## Visual Code

Two extension are super handy:

 1) Container Tools (previous Docker)
 2) SQL-Tools for direct database access
 3) PHP Profiler, to test what took so long
 4) PHP Debug, to troubleshoot and step debug

The last two are only needed if one does theme or plugin development. Debugging / Profiling also needs a browser xdebug plugin. Watch the `/logs` folder for apache and xdebug logs. Make sure to set the proper setting in `xdebug.ini` and reboot the web server. Also check the section on `launch.json`

## Database access

Normally you won't need database access from outside so the `db` server is not bridged. If you _do_ need access add a port mapping in the db service and restart the container.

## Setup xdebug `launch.json`

* Install xdebug extension
* create launch.json (open the xdebug tab and click "create a launch.json file" )
* click the gear icon and add this to the configurations section in `launch.json` file (for instance directly below the `"port": 9003,` line)

```js
"pathMappings": {
    "/var/www/html": "${workspaceFolder}/app"
}
```

and save the file. This assumes you have your webroot in a folder _app_ as indicated above.

## Move the project

As all key ingredients sit on in the file system, moving or copying the project is easy. Zip the project including `app` and `db` folders and unzip it somewhere else;. Make sure in Docker Desktop to shutdown the database first.
